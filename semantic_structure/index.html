            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, the standard language for creating web pages, used to structure and present content on the internet. It employs markup to annotate text, images, and other content, instructing web browsers on how to display these elements by using tags, attributes, and other codes.
            How HTML works:
            Markup Language: HTML uses codes, or "markup," to describe different types of content on a webpage.
            Structure: It defines the structure of web content, organizing it into sections, paragraphs, lists, and other blocks.
            Tags: HTML elements consist of opening and closing tags that wrap around content, such as  for a paragraph or for a main heading.
            Attributes: Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about an element, like href for a hyperlink's URL or src for an image source.
            Hyperlinks: The "Hypertext" in HTML refers to links that connect web pages, allowing users to navigate seamlessly between different resources on the web.

        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used in web development to describe the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language, most commonly HTML. It is a fundamental technology of the World Wide Web, working alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        In essence, CSS controls the visual appearance of web pages. While HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage (like the foundation and walls of a house), CSS is responsible for the aesthetics (like the paint, wallpaper, and decorations).
        Key aspects of CSS:
        Styling: CSS defines how HTML elements are displayed, including properties such as colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, and layout.
        Separation of Concerns: It promotes the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), making web development more organized and maintainable.
        Cascading: The "cascading" in CSS refers to the way styles are applied and prioritized. Multiple style sheets can be applied to a document, and a specific set of rules determines which style takes precedence when there are conflicting declarations.CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used in web development to describe the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language, most commonly HTML.

    <h2>Why Semantic HTML Matters</h2>
    <p>Semantic HTML helps both developers and browsers understand the structure and meaning of content on a webpage. 
    By using semantic tags such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, 
    <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, the document becomes more accessible, 
    easier to maintain, and better optimized for search engines.</p>
